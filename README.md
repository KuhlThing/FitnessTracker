### Fitness Tracker 
## User Story 
As A user who is out of shape,
I WANT an app to keep a log of my workouts,
SO THAT I can keep track of my progress.

This app currently only works locally. I couldn't get the deployed [Heroku app](https://vast-shore-35049.herokuapp.com/) to function.

The purpose of this app is to log and chart your workout progress. It uses node.js and MongoDB.

#### To start the app
1. Open a terminal
2. Type "npm i" and press Enter
3. Type "npm start" and press Enter
4. Open a browser window and navigate to localhost:3000

#### To use the app
1. Select New Workout or Continue Workout
2. Select Resistance or Cardio from the dropdown menu.
3. Follow prompts to fill in your workout information.
4. Click Add Exercise or Complete

The landing page will show a summary of your workout progress, and the Dashboard link at the top will display a chart of your workout history.
